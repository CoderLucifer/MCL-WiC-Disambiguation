## Paper Title: PAW at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation : Exploring Cross Lingual Transfer, Augmentations and Adversarial Training

## Paper Abstract:

We experiment with XLM RoBERTa for Word in Context Disambiguation in the Multi Lingual and Cross Lingual setting so as to develop a single model having knowledge about both settings. We solve the problem as a binary classification problem and also experiment with data augmentation and adversarial training techniques. In addition, we also experiment with a 2-stage training technique. Our approaches prove to be beneficial for better performance and robustness.
